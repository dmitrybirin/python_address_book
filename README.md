Address book implemetation as task

Task content:

Develop standart Adress Book functionality with Python 2.7 with storing the following data:
- Full Name
- Phone number
- Birthday

As a plus, develop 'Reminder' feature to remind about birthday upon run

## Implementation

Because of lack of time, I've not included tests at the beginning.

I've decided to go with the interactive pattern instead of arguments.

I've decided to use csv instead of familiar json, cause it be more easy to implement import/export in future, for example.

## Run

```
python run.py
```
